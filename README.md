Hardware diagrams and arduino code


## Setup
### Equipment
1x Arduino MKR NB 1500
1x Hydrolab HL4
1x Solar Panel
1x Container
1x 12V Battery
1x Solar Charge Controller
1x 12V to 5V USB Converter

### Wiring
ALl equipment is installed inside the container with the solar panel and HL4 seperate but wired into the container. 

- The SDI-12 orange cable (data) is wired to port 7 on the arduino and the blue (data GND) is wired to the ground on the arduino.
- The battery is wired into the solar charge controller and the arduino/HL4 are wired into the output of the solar charge controller. The arduino usb should be plugged in once everything else is wired and on.
